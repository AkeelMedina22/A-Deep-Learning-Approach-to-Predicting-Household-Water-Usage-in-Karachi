# About the Project

This is project for the course Deep Learning in collaboration with the [Karachi Water Project](https://www.karachiwaterproject.com/).

## Abstract

Water shortage is an increasingly critical problem for countries worldwide, and water usage prediction is crucial for effective long-term planning. This research presents a deep-learning approach to predict water usage for a household based on smart-meter data and weather conditions. We have used LSTMs for prediction based on existing literature for accurate long-time forecasting. The dataset used is the water usage data for a single household in Karachi that has been collected by the Karachi Water Project using smart meters. The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to predict future water usage for the household, which can then be generalised for a larger number of households, and potentially predict water usage for the city of Karachi on a larger scale - and aid future water planning and distribution.
